        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>The apple tree (Malus pumila, commonly and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in the
            rose
            family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and
            is
            the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
            ancestor,
            Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and
            were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in
            many
            cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions. </p>
        <p>Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally apple varieties are propagated by grafting onto
            rootstocks,
            which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting
            in
            a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including
            cooking,
            eating raw and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest
            problems,
            which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was
            sequenced
            as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production. </p>

        <h3>Production Level</h3>
        <p>Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 80.8 million tonnes, with China accounting for 49% of the total.
