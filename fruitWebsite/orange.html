        <p>The orange (specifically, the sweet orange) is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus � sinensis in the
            family
            Rutaceae. </p>
        <p> The fruit of the Citrus � sinensis is considered a sweet orange, whereas the fruit of the Citrus � aurantium
            is
            considered a bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony);
            varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations. </p> The orange is a hybrid, between pomelo (Citrus
        maxima)
        and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). It has genes that are ~25% pomelo and ~75% mandarin;however, it is not a
        simple
        backcrossed BC1 hybrid, but hybridized over multiple generations. The chloroplast genes, and therefore the
        maternal
        line, seem to be pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. Earlier estimates of the percentage
        of
        pomelo genes varying from ~50% to 6% have been reported.
        <p></p>
        <p> Sweet oranges were mentioned in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the
            most
            cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for
            their
            sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel.
            As of
            2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production. </p>

        <h3>Production Level</h3>
        <p>In 2013, 71.4 million metric tons of oranges were grown worldwide, production being highest in Brazil and the
            U.S. states of Florida and California. </p>
