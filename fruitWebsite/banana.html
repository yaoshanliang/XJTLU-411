        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>The banana is an edible fruit, botanically a berry,[1][2] produced by several kinds of large herbaceous
            flowering
            plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, in
            contrast to
            dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved,
            with
            soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
            The
            fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic
            (seedless)
            bananas come from two wild species � Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most
            cultivated
            bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa � paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata � M.
            balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer
            used.
        </p>
        <p> Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated
            in
            Papua New Guinea.[4][5] They are grown in 135 countries,[6] primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser
            extent to
            make fiber, banana wine and banana beer and as ornamental plants. </p>
        <p> Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between &quot;bananas&quot; and &quot;plantains&quot;. Especially
            in
            the Americas and Europe, &quot;banana&quot; usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly
            those
            of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, Musa
            cultivars
            with firmer, starchier fruit are called &quot;plantains&quot;. In other regions, such as Southeast Asia,
            many
            more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the simple two-fold distinction is not useful and is not made
            in
            local languages. </p>
        <p> The term &quot;banana&quot; is also used as the common name for the plants which produce the fruit.[3] This
            can
            extend to other members of the genus Musa like the scarlet banana (Musa coccinea), pink banana (Musa
            velutina)
            and the Fe'i bananas. It can also refer to members of the genus Ensete, like the snow banana (Ensete
            glaucum)
            and the economically important false banana (Ensete ventricosum). Both genera are classified under the
            banana
            family, Musaceae. </p>

        <h3> Production </h3>
        <p> Statistics on the production and export of bananas and plantains are available from the Food and Agriculture
            Organization. Some countries produce statistics which distinguish between bananas and plantains, but two of
            the
            top three producers (India and China) do not, so comparisons can only be made using the total for bananas
            and
            plantains combined. The 2012 statistics show that India led the world in banana production, producing around
            18%
            of the worldwide crop of 139 million metric tonnes. Philippines was the next largest producer with around 7%
            of
            the worldwide crop. Its national data does distinguish between bananas and plantains, and shows that the
            latter
            made up over 95% of production. Ten countries produced around two thirds of the total world production. </p>
