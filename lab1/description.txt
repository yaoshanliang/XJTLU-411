I divided the HTML file into five files: home page, apple, orange, lemon and banana. Each file is linked to style.css file.

As is shown in the CSS, I set the font of the whole body as times, and set the background color of the body. All the colors in the CSS file are from a famous CSS color sampling site (https://www.mdui.org/design/style/color.html#color-color-tool), it can help me to create, share color schemes, and apply color schemes to the UI. I set the font of the p tag to Cambria, size 16, with the first line indented. H1-H3 tags are set to different colors and sizes of 30px, 24px, and 20px, respectively. The border of the table tag has also been set to 1px solid to make it more readable. In addition, I also added a color to the a tag and a color to the a hover state of a tag. The image also has an added border and background color. This will make the whole page look neat and coordinated.

When writing the code, I strictly follow the CSS code specifications, refer to the website (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text) knowledge, using white space and indenting. The overall code looks clear and readable, which also helps me overview the knowledge of css.
